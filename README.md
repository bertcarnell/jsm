## NISS Luncheon (8/4 1200)

### Veridical Data Science

Talked with Professor Bin Yu (UC Berkeley) about her book: [Veridical Data Science](https://vdsbook.com/).

### AI in Practice:  Transitions and Tools

Dr. Nancy McMillan, Battelle

### Harvard Data Science Review

Xiao-Li Meng showed this great resource [here](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/) and [here](https://datascience.harvard.edu/)

## Recent Developments in Causal Inference (8/4 1600)

### A Meta-Learning Method fo Estimation of Causal Excursion Effects to Assess Time-Varying Moderation

Micro-randomized Trials - The idea that you can treat a longitudinal study where the same treatment is applied multiple times and treat it like a raondomized trial.

Applications to Next Best Offer are possible.

Jieru Shi - University of Michigan

Need to learn more about doubly robust estimators for causal inference:  They estimate the Averate Treatment Effect using both regression and inverse probability weighting methods.

### Other Presentation

Beeswarm plots [here](https://r-graph-gallery.com/beeswarm.html) and [here](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/api_examples/plots/beeswarm.html)

Can we add this to the torndado package?

### Using GPT for Market Research - Ayelet Israeli - Harvard Business School

- Used GPT as a random customer sampling mechanism and examined the distribution of its responses
- When prompted as a random customer, GPT exhibits behaviors consistent with economic theory (price elasticity)
- GPT-based estimates are realistic and consistent with values obtained from existing research

### Using Multimodal LLM to Extract and Discover Features from Ad Images - Poppy Zhang, Meta

Trained a classifier to extrat the important parts of an image for Meta customers
